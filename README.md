# Creating Token

This Solidity code is a “Token Creation” script that showcases the fundamental syntax and capabilities of the Solidity programming language.

## Description

This code is a basic contract composed in Solidity, a coding language utilized for crafting smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract includes a function that allows you to generate your own token.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To execute this program, Remix, an online Solidity IDE, can be utilized. Begin by visiting the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

To compile the code, navigate to the “Solidity Compiler” tab on the left-hand sidebar. Ensure the “Compiler” option is set to “0.8.4” (or another version that is compatible), and then hit the “Compile HelloWorld.sol” button.

After the code has been compiled, the contract can be deployed by selecting the “Deploy & Run Transactions” tab on the left-hand sidebar.

Once the contract has been deployed, interaction can begin by first entering a value and then copying the account address. The next step is to navigate to the mint function and paste the copied account address. Then, enter a value in the mint function and transact. The next step involves checking the balance to see how much is available. Finally, repeat the same procedure with the mint function by pasting the address and entering a value for how much will be deducted from the current balance. After these steps, the program you created can now be tested.
